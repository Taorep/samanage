# samanage

samanage development challenge. 

~98% identical to image given in test folder. 
(hide overflow-y and F11 screen for comparison used)


responsive design tested on latest versions of 
-ie
-chrome
-moz
-opera 
-edge 


Developer notes:

That was a little more challenging than I had anticipated. 
There are a few loose "rem" values in my CSS; I was going for IE8 and up compatibility. 
There are a few poorly made media query rules due to scss nesting

Final thoughts: 

thank you so much for this opportunity! 
I built this using HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and a little help from bootstrap.
