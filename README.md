# samanage

samanage development challenge.

~98% identical to image given in test folder. (hide overflow-y and F11 screen for comparison used)

responsive design tested on latest versions of -ie -chrome -moz -opera -edge

Developer notes:

That was a little more challenging than I had anticipated. There are a few loose "rem" values in my CSS; I was going for IE8 and up compatibility. There are a few poorly made media query rules due to scss nesting

Final thoughts:

thank you so much for this opportunity! I built this using HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and a little help from bootstrap. Editor: Atom
